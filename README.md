# BPFormatted

This is a back-port of the .formatted API in Foundation that was introduced at WWDC '21 for iOS 15, macOS 12.0, tvOS 15.0, and watchOS 8.0.

Most developers cannot start developing their apps from those platforms and upwards.

But now they can! This package provides the same nice api for projects starting at **iOS 9.0, macOS 10.10, tvOS 9.0 and watchOS 2.0**!!!

## Goal

To provide the exact same api with the exact same results as Apple's Foundation api.

## Features

What's already available and what's to come.

- [x] Date
- [x] ISO8601
- [ ] DateInterval
- [ ] DateComponents
- [ ] List
- [ ] Measurement
- [ ] PersonNameComponent
- [ ] RelativeDate
- [ ] ByteCount
- [ ] String parsing (maybe)

## Warning

Since the current release of Foundation this is based on is still in b√®ta, everything is still subject to change.
